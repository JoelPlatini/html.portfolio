    <p>Here are some examples of my achievements, </p>
    <ol>
         <li>
            Wrote B2B blogs on the latest trending topics targeting SaaS audiences, business owners, and Subject matter experts. Followed precise structure, potential KWs, and SEO guidelines to ensure the blogs ranked in the Top 10 on Google SERP. 

            Instead of stat-padding, I used my exceptional writing skill to tell a story that added more value to the readers and decreased the website's bounce rate.
         </li> 
         <br>
         <li>
            Used strong copywriting skills to write landing pages that outrank competitor pages and rank in the Top 5 position of Google SERP. Wrote multiple successful Outreach email series for Link building, Guest post collaboration, and Black Friday sales. 

            Collaborated with development teams to write product updates and monthly newsletters to keep customers in the loop.
         </li>
         <br>
         <li>
            Performed detailed competitor analysis to identify the KW and resource gap. Used those data and tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, and Google Analytics to identify topics to write cluster content that went on to increase the total ranking KWs from 1200 to 2400. 

            I am looking forward to opportunities where I get to use my proven industry experience to convert product and customer data into user-friendly content which would serve as a Sales magnet. 
         </li>
